This repository offers a lightweight graphical user interface that might
be used in PortMaster and/or other graphical programs running on AmberElec
and similar retro handhelds. It's designed for low powered systems that
lack x-windows and other window managers, using pySDL2 to access the SDL2
functionality included with most systems. Written in pure python, it has
no other dependencies. User input from game controllers and keyboards is
provided, with touchscreen support coming in the future.
